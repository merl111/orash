todo:
- implement args for builtins
- improve build system, cmake/autogen whatever, but plain make is ugly af.
- implement OCI
- signal handler for graceful shutdown.
- pin results ( save query results to view again later )
- table print for result, check OCI lib if there's already something
- helper functions to read/write buffers/files

should be done:
- fix hints, show only part left from hint.
- real multiline edit, need to extend libnoise for that, maybe PR upstream then. [in progress]
