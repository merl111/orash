todo:
- improve build system
- signal handler for graceful shutdown. [done for debug, should also get a release version]
- add config processor for .orashrc
- add spool/redirect
- connection manager
- implement OCI
- implement safe strcpy (maybe strcpy_s)
- pin results ( save query results to view again later )
- table print for result, check OCI lib if there's already something
- helper functions to read/write buffers/files
- read enviroment variables
- filename completion

future:
- simple enviroment struct, should be easier to handlu multiple OCI connections then
- status line, schema browser, needs ncurses or termbox, bigger task

should be done:
- implement args for builtins
- fix hints, show only part left from hint.
