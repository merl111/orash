todo:
- signal handler for graceful shutdown. [done for debug, should also get a release version]
- add config processor for .orashrc
- add spool/redirect
- connection manager
- implement OCI                                                                                        [in progress] merl111
- parser for all shell commands (should be done with flex/bison)                                       [in progress] merl111
- autocompletion for sql
- autocompletion for plsql
- implement safe strcpy (maybe strcpy_s)
- pin results ( save query results to view again later )
- table print for result, check OCI lib if there's already something
- helper functions to read/write buffers/files
- read enviroment variables
- filename completion

future:
- simple enviroment struct, should be easier to handle multiple OCI connections then                    [orash.h] 
- status line
- schema browser, needs ncurses or termbox, bigger task
- maybe a gui? 

should be done:
- improve build system
- implement args for builtins
- fix hints, show only part left from hint.

notes:

Everything that should be shared within a shell session (not database session) can be added to orash_t struct defined in
orash.h. A this struct is initialized in main and a pointer from it is passed wherever needed.

The parser is useful to distinguish between builtin commands, dml, ddl statements, could also parse plsql later on and 
be used as a linter for sql/plsql one day.
